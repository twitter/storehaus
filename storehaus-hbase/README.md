## Storehaus HBASE

This module contains two separate HBase Store implementations, one using traditional HBase client from [Apache](http://hbase.apache.org/book/client.html) and second using AsyncHbase from [OpenTSDB](https://github.com/OpenTSDB/asynchbase/). These client implementations are mutually exclusive i.e you cannot use both at the same time. Please read below carefully to pick the right implementation for your use case

If you are planning on using a newer version of HBase which require zookeeper 3.4.x with SummingBird/Storm, you will running into this [ZooKeeper dependency mismatch issue](https://github.com/nathanmarz/storm/pull/225). Basically you can only use 3.3.x version of ZooKeeper with storm and newer HBase version of Apache HBase client only work with ZooKeeper 3.4.x. In this case, your best bet is to use the Stores in `com.twitter.storehaus.asynchbase` which lets you talk to new Hbase by leveraging older version of ZooKeeper. If you are planning on using HBase Store with something other than SummingBird/Storm you can pick either implementation based on your needs. The key difference between the two is that one is using ZooKeeper 3.3.X and other is using 3.4.x
